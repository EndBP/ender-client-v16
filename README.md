# What is Ender-Client?
Ender Client is a fully-free minecraft education edition client that can make your school experience easier. This has over 50 working commands (53 in total) and you can use them to troll your friends. Not only that but you can use the building commands and build yourself a nice looking world. I would use this if I were you.

> Most likely Ender Client will not receive anymore updates after 1.6.
